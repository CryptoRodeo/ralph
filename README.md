# Ralph (Work in progress)

Files, utilities and best practices related to [Ralph loops](https://ghuntley.com/ralph/)

## Quick Start

Initialize Ralph in your project with a single command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CryptoRodeo/ralph/refs/heads/main/ralph_init.sh | bash
```

This will download `ralph.sh`, create `progress.txt` and `prd.json` files, and set up everything you need to start using Ralph loops.
